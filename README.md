## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting cyber hacking breaches using machine learning and statistical models. By leveraging a dataset spanning 12 years (2005â€“2017), we aim to uncover patterns in breach incidents and develop predictive models to enhance cybersecurity measures.

## Features
- Statistical analysis of cyber breaches
- Machine learning-based breach prediction
- Data visualization using graphs and charts
- Secure user authentication and data management
- Trend analysis for cybersecurity insights

## System Architecture
The system consists of a Django-based backend with MySQL for data storage, complemented by a user-friendly frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Django
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Machine Learning:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd cyber-breach-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Setup the database:
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Start the Django server:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
1. **User Registration & Login:** Create an account and log in.
2. **Upload Data:** Upload breach-related datasets for analysis.
3. **Analysis & Prediction:** The system processes the data and predicts potential breaches.
4. **Visualization:** View results through interactive charts and tables.

## Results
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in breach prediction.
- Provides insights into cyber threats and trends over time.
- Helps organizations prepare for potential cyber threats.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for improved predictions.
- Expand dataset coverage for real-time analysis.
- Develop a real-time breach monitoring system.
